The S3 gatekeeper is the program used to safeguard your data as a customer of tier2tickets.com. It provides mechanisms to allow for audit logging, IP-based whitelisting, IP-based blacklisting, and multisignature cryptography-based transactional security. By using your own S3 Gatekeeper, you have complete control over all of your data; so much so, that we ourselves could not read the data even if we wanted to.
